		Energia Multi-Threaded (EMT) Wiring Support

         	    https://gitorious.design.ti.com/emt

This tree provide a multi-threaded Wiring lbrary implementation bases on 
TI-RTOS.

To Clone this Tree
------------------
    o you must already have a https://gitorious.design.ti.com account, then
    o clone the tree using git:
        git clone git@gitorious.design.ti.com:emt/emt.git ./emt

To Contribute
-------------
If you haven't already done so, create a personal branch with your name, for
example, "me":
        git branch me
        git checkout me

The "normal" development cycle:
    o make and test improvements
        emacs Control.c
	    :
	
    o commit changes to your local repo
        git add src/apps/robot/Control.c ...
        git commit -m "improved ..."

	git add src/apps/robot/ti/drivers/wifi/WiFiTivaCC3000.c
	git commit -m "fixed ..."

    o push the changes from your local branch to the corresponding gitorious 
      repo's branch
        git push origin me:me

    o to get copies of other's changes
        git fetch

Weekly integrations: Your contributions will be periodically reviewed and
merged into the gitorious repo's master branch.  To ensure your contributions
can be easily merged on the gitorious master branch, you must 

    o get latest master branch from the gitorious repo
        git fetch

    o merge any changes into your branch
        git merge origin/master

    o push your local branch to the corresponding gitorious repo's branch
        git push origin me:me

To Create a Gitorious Account
-----------------------------
    o download the git command line tools (Windows http://msysgit.github.io/)

    o create an SSH key:
          ssh-keygen -t rsa
      Just press 'Enter' in every question it asks and you will finally have
      your pair of keys under the folder ".ssh". For example, type
      "cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub". That's the public key that you are required 
      to copy and paste into your account on Gitorious. 

    o browse to https://gitorious.design.ti.com and create an account using 
      the public key you just created; copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      to the specified text box.

To Create a Gitorous Project
----------------------------
This tree is hosted on the Gitorious server https://gitorious.design.ti.com
and was initially created on Linux and pushed to Gitorious as follows:
    cd <top of the initial tree>
    git init
    git add README src/
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git remote add origin git@gitorious.design.ti.com:emt/emt.git
    git push origin master

Librarian repo creation
-----------------------
The emt.git repo was created to "track" the repo maintained at 
gitoroius.ti.com and was created as follows:
        git clone --bare git@gitorious.design.ti.com:emt/emt.git emt.git
        cd emt.git/
        git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*"
        git tag emt-a00
        git push --tags

Note: xlibrary must be given read/write access to the Gitorious repo cloning 
of pushing any changes.  This must be done via the Gitoroius web interface 
(blech!)

Librarian releases
------------------
    Build this tree from Linux using standard ggentree/SM-MAKE/greltree except
    for the addition of a step to update the local emt.repo with the content
    from gitorious.
    
    # update local copy of the gitorous repo
    cd emt.git; git fetch; cd ..

    # clone the tree and merge/review user content
    ggentree emt.git/
    cd emt-a??
    git merge origin/dr

    # build the tree
    SM-MAKE .clean
    SM-MAKE .all-files >& Make.log 

    # update README 
    emacs README
    git commit -a -m emt-a??

    # release the tree
    greltree -u dr -m "something brief and meaningful"
