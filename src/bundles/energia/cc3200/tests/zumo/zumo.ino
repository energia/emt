/*  ======== zumo.ino ========
 *  Simple demo of the CC3200 Zumo platform
 *
 *  This example creates an access point named tink3AP with password
 *  "password" and a simple command/telemetry server on port 8080.
 *
 *  The command server allows any WiFi client to drive the Zumo using WASD
 *  keystrokes and acquire IMU telemetry data for real-time display.
 *
 *  Two examples of such a client are provided in the ./Processing
 *  sub-directory: zgraph and zecho.  Both are Processing applications (which
 *  uses the development IDE that inspired the Energia/Wiring development
 *  environment; see https://processing.org).
